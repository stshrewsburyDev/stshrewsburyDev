# Hello world, Welcome to my GitHub profile!
#### Created by Steven Shrewsbury of course.

Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile, here you can find some of my programming projects that I have made/work on.
I am just a regular human and programmer, in my spare time I like to play games (like Portal 1/2 and Minecraft) and program random and questionable things.

Main language I work with is Python but have some experiance in web-dev (Mainly just HTML and CSS, JS is a rather big weak point)
